# User Engagement Analysis Of A Website

## Project Overview  

User Engagement Analysis is a data-driven approach to evaluating and understanding how users interact with a product, service, or platform. By analyzing key metrics and behavioral patterns, it provides valuable insights into user preferences, engagement levels, and satisfaction. This analysis enables businesses to make informed decisions to enhance user experience, refine marketing strategies, and improve overall product or service performance.  

To conduct User Engagement Analysis, businesses require data that captures user interactions, including visit frequency, user actions (e.g., clicks, purchases), session duration, time spent on specific pages, and feedback provided. Understanding these metrics helps optimize offerings and improve retention strategies.  

###  Focus on Bounce Rate Analysis  
One critical aspect of user engagement is bounce rate, which measures the percentage of visitors who land on a website and leave without further interaction. A high bounce rate may indicate issues with user experience, content relevance, or page performance.  

Given a dataset containing bounce rate, session duration, and other user behavior metrics, this project aims to:  
- Analyze the overall bounce rate of the website.  
- Identify patterns and trends in the relationship between bounce rate and session duration.  
- Segment users based on their bounce rate behaviors to uncover engagement insights.  

By extracting meaningful insights, this analysis helps improve website effectiveness, optimize content strategies, and enhance user retention. 

## Key Features

- Visualization of user behavior insights

## Tech Stack
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Data Handling: CSV 
- Visualization:  Plotly

## Dataset
A dataset from a website with 999 entries and 4 columns namely, Client ID, Sessions, Avg. Session Duration and Bounce rate.
- Client ID: A unique identifier assigned to each user or device to track interactions across multiple sessions. It helps distinguish individual users in analytics.

- Sessions: A session represents a group of user interactions with a website or app within a given timeframe. A session starts when a user visits and ends after inactivity or when they leave.

- Avg. Session Duration: The average amount of time users spend on the website during a session. It indicates user engagement and content effectiveness.

- Bounce Rate: The percentage of sessions where users leave after viewing only one page without any further interaction. A high bounce rate may indicate poor user experience or irrelevant content.

## Data Analysis and Insights
- User visit frequency distribution
- Engagement time and retention trends
- User segmentation based on behavior
